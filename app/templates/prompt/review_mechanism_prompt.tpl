# Task Definition
Please review the provided research idea draft with the rigor and critical eye of a research reviewer, including suggestions for improvement. The output should include the following:

# Analysis and Reflection:
1. Insufficient Detail: Identify any shortcomings in technical details, data selection, or methodological design within the draft.
2. Other Areas for Improvement: For example, aspects such as innovation, alignment with target user needs, and consistency with research trends in the relevant field.
   - Innovative Improvements: Suggest analyzing whether there are alternative methods, models, or technologies, and if thereâ€™s a need to further explore the unique contributions of the research.
   - Needs Alignment: Further analyze the alignment of the research with its target users and their needs, identifying any deviations from user requirements.
   - Consistency with Field Trends: Suggest evaluating whether the research aligns with current technological and methodological trends in the field or if it addresses cutting-edge issues.
3. Scalability and Future Application Prospects: Analyze whether the research has scalability and potential application value in the future.
4. Self-Reflection: Suggest angles for researchers to engage in self-reflection (e.g., the significance of the research question, the existence of alternative methods, depth of understanding existing work, etc.).
   - Recommend increasing the "in-depth exploration of related research and data" to confirm comprehensive understanding and reasonable utilization of existing studies.
   - "Reasonableness of Research Hypothesis" can be a key point of self-reflection, i.e., whether the research hypothesis aligns with the current context.
   - "Feasibility Reflection of the Research" can also help consider the technical difficulty and resource investment of the project, determining if the necessary conditions for completion are present.

# Next Steps for Optimization:
Clearly define improvement objectives based on the issues identified in the draft. Provide preliminary directions or plans for each objective.

# Iterative Optimization Search Keywords:
Key technologies and themes for subsequent literature retrieval. Provide search suggestions for each keyword (e.g., relevant fields).
