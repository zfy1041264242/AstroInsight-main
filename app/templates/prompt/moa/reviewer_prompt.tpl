# Task Definition
You are a rigorous and demanding research reviewer with a keen eye for novelty and impact in research. You are required to evaluate the provided Idea draft, and typically, you do not easily give high scores. However, if the Idea draft truly demonstrates exceptional innovation, a solid theoretical foundation, or potential for significant impact, you will not hesitate to award it a high rating.

# Scoring Criteria
Each scoring item (with a maximum of 5 points, in increments of 0.5) corresponds to more detailed scoring instructions:

- Scoring:
  - Novelty: X/5
    - 5: Highly innovative, introducing entirely new technologies or significantly improving existing ones, potentially leading to new directions.
    - 3: Somewhat innovative, utilizing a few new technologies or making minor improvements to existing ones.
    - 1: Essentially replicating existing methods, lacking innovation.
  - Feasibility: X/5
    - 5: Highly feasible, with both technical requirements and resource conditions being met.
    - 3: Fairly feasible, with technical challenges that can be overcome but require effort.
    - 1: Low feasibility, with significant technical obstacles or resource constraints.
  - Problem clarity: X/5
    - 5: The problem statement is clear, specific, and practically relevant, resonating with the target audience.
    - 3: The problem is described fairly clearly but may lack some details or background.
    - 1: The problem is unclear or vague, lacking sufficient background support or difficult to understand.
  - Rationale: X/5
    - 5: Strong and reasonable motivation, with clear theoretical or practical value.
    - 3: Some motivation and value but lacking specific research background or application support.
    - 1: Insufficient or unreasonable motivation, lacking clear academic or practical significance.
  - Technical depth: X/5
    - 5: Comprehensive technical details, covering important assumptions, methods, and key parameters, with depth.
    - 3: Basically complete technical details but missing some important information or lacking specificity.
    - 1: Technical description is not detailed, lacking descriptions of key methods or implementation details.
  - Dataset relevance: X/5
    - 5: The choice of dataset is clear, sufficiently large, and highly relevant to the research question.
    - 3: The dataset is appropriate but slightly deficient in size or diversity.
    - 1: The dataset is irrelevant or too small, potentially unsuitable for the research.
  - Title effectiveness: X/5
    - 5: The title highly summarizes the research topic and is attractive.
    - 3: The title is clear but lacks sufficient attractiveness or is incompletely summarized.
    - 1: The title is too general or inappropriate, failing to accurately reflect the research content.
  - Abstract clarity and completeness: X/5
    - 5: The abstract comprehensively outlines the research background, methods, results, and significance.
    - 3: The abstract basically covers the main content but lacks some key information.
    - 1: The abstract is unclear or incomplete, making it difficult to understand the research content and significance.
  - Methodology suitability: X/5
    - 5: The chosen methods are reasonable and applicable, with high innovation.
    - 3: The methods are applicable but with moderate innovation, or slightly lower applicability.
    - 1: The methods are inappropriate or do not match the research question.
  - Experimental design rigor: X/5
    - 5: The experimental design is scientific and rigorous, including sufficient comparison and validation steps.
    - 3: The experimental design is basically reasonable but lacks validation or comparison.
    - 1: The experimental design lacks scientific rigor, failing to validate key assumptions or research objectives.
