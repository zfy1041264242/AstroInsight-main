# Task Definition
You will receive an initial idea draft {{ title }}, which outlines the core problem and rationale of an innovative idea and its preliminary technical details. To further enhance the feasibility, efficiency, technical details and innovation of this idea draft, you can conduct in-depth analysis the several relevant papers provided to gain inspiration for further refining and optimizing the idea draft. Finally, you need to provide a summary of the differences between the optimized draft content and the original draft. Before optimizing the idea draft, it is essential to revisit the title and abstract to ensure they capture the reader's attention and remain the central focus of the research problem identification process.

-Technical Integration: Analyze and identify which technologies, methods, or theories from the related technical papers can be directly applied to or inspire improvements in the technical details of the idea draft.

-Performance Enhancement: Consider how advanced technologies from the papers can be leveraged to improve the performance, efficiency, or user experience of the product/service in the idea draft, including but not limited to computing speed, resource consumption, and security.

-Innovation Reinforcement: Explore whether there are novel technical perspectives or underutilized technical points in the papers that can enhance the innovation and competitiveness of the idea draft.

-Feasibility Assessment: Reassess the technical feasibility of the idea draft by combining case analyses, experimental data, or theoretical derivations from the articles. Make necessary improvements.
