# Task Definition
You will receive an idea draft, which outlines the core problem and rationale of an innovative idea and its preliminary technical details. To further enhance the feasibility, efficiency, or innovativeness of this idea, you should first refer to the provided "# Objectives for optimizing the next idea draft" and "# Keywords for optimizing the next idea draft" content, which will provide you with specific directions for optimization. Subsequently, you can conduct in-depth analysis the several relevant papers provided to gain inspiration for further refining and optimizing the idea draft. Finally, you need to provide a summary of the differences between the optimized draft content and the original draft. Before optimizing the idea draft, it is essential to revisit the title and abstract to ensure they capture the reader's attention and remain the central focus of the research problem identification process.
